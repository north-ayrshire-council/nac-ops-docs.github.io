# Welcome to NAC OPs Docs
## Why? :confused:

How often do we see > __does anyone know anything about...?__ or a variation > __where would I find docs about...?__  

Would it not be amazing if we had **one** place to go that had up-to-date documentation that was searchable :mag:

The idea with this POC is to demonstrate that this could be possible using version control and open tools. 

!!! quote
    "Documentation is a love letter that you write to your future self."

## What do we need? :+1:

* Documentation written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
* Using Git version control in [Github](https://github.com/north-ayrshire-council)
* Using [Material for MKDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
* Built automatically using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
* Published to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

!!! Info
    Github Pages is currently a public site, however if adopted I propose that we use Github Enterprise.  
    This would allow us to [control access to our documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/changing-the-visibility-of-your-github-pages-site)
